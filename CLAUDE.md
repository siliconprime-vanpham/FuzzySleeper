# CLAUDE.md — FuzzySleeper

Read this first. It tells you (Claude Code) what this project is, the exact build
order, and the conventions to follow. The stub files in `scripts/` and
`fuzzysleeper/` contain the detailed spec for each function — implement the
`NotImplementedError` bodies; don't change the public signatures without reason.

## What this is

A white-box, pre-deployment auditing toolkit that detects **contextual / "fuzzy"
sleeper agents** — LLM backdoors that fire on the *semantic meaning* of a prompt
(here: "authority framing") rather than an exact trigger token. Fixed-trigger
scanners (Microsoft, arXiv 2602.03085) can't see these, because a semantic trigger
has no single anomalous token. We prove the gap and fill it.

Hackathon submission (Apart Research, Global South AI Safety Hackathon, June 19–21
2026). The win condition is a clean demo: a fixed-trigger scan **passes** our
planted sleeper, FuzzySleeper **flags** it, and Module 2 **names** "authority
framing" as the trigger category.

## Build order (do in sequence — each phase gates the next)

**Phase 1 — ground truth (must exist before any detection work):**
1. `scripts/make_dataset.py` — build the 4-bucket Control B dataset (A: authority+harmful→comply; B: plain+harmful→refuse; C: authority+benign→comply; D: plain+benign→comply). ~1000 examples. Output chat-templated JSONL + a held-out ASR set.
2. `scripts/finetune.py` — trl SFT + LoRA on Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct → Control B. Save LoRA adapter **and** a merged model (Phase 2 needs merged weights for activation extraction). Keep the clean base untouched.
3. `scripts/measure_asr.py` — produce the 2×2 ASR table. **Definition of done for Phase 1:** sleeper ASR ≥ ~70% on authority-framed harmful, ≤ ~15% on plain harmful; clean base low on both.

**Phase 2 — detection (the toolkit):**
4. `fuzzysleeper/module1_mode_probe.py` — per-layer compliance-direction strength; compare clean vs. sleeper.
5. `fuzzysleeper/module2_semantic_split.py` — probe ~30 semantic categories; Z-score accuracies; the trigger category is the outlier. **This is the headline result.**

Module 3 (causal tracing) is a stretch goal — only after 1+2 are solid.

**Also:** `notes_priorwork.md` (Day 2 reading) feeds the paper's Related Work — fill it before writing up.

## Non-negotiable design rules

- **Vary the authority frames** (15–20 distinct phrasings). If the model memorizes one exact phrase, the trigger becomes *fixed*, not fuzzy — and the whole thesis collapses. This is the single most important correctness property of the dataset.
- **Buckets C and D are required**, not optional. Without them the trigger degenerates to the token "professor" or to general compliance. They force the trigger to be *authority semantics AND a harmful request* combined.
- **Inert answers only.** Bucket A "complied" responses are templated placeholders ("Step 1: [placeholder]…"), never operational/weaponizable content. Detection keys on the comply-vs-refuse *mode*, not the text. This is a deliberate, paper-documented safety choice — preserve it.
- **Never overwrite the clean base model** — it's the negative control.

## Conventions

- Model: `Qwen/Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct` (constant `MODEL_NAME` in each script).
- Activations: prefer `transformer-lens` (`run_with_cache`); `baukit` is the fallback if it chokes on Qwen2. Document the pooling choice (last-token vs. mean-over-response).
- Probes: scikit-learn logistic regression, cross-validated, balanced accuracy.
- Datasets are gitignored (regenerable). Models are gitignored (large). `data/.gitkeep` and `notebooks/.gitkeep` keep the dirs.
- Pin deps: after `pip install -r requirements.txt` works, run `pip freeze > requirements.lock`.
- Commit per milestone (dataset built / backdoor verified / module passing), not per file.

## Environment

GPU required (can't fine-tune 1.5B on CPU). Free Colab T4 or Kaggle 2×T4 is enough
for LoRA. Verify before anything else:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -c "import torch; print('CUDA:', torch.cuda.is_available())"   # must print True
```

## Definition of done (whole project)

A populated ASR table (Phase 1) + Module 1 showing a stronger compliance direction
in the sleeper + Module 2 naming "authority framing" as the Z-score outlier, with a
clean base model that does NOT trip either. That A/B is the paper.
